# 🚀 **TOP Interview & LeetCode Questions Based on Exact Same Pattern OF Two Recursive Calls**



---

# ✅ **1. Subsequence / Subset Related (Pick or Not Pick)**

✔ **Exactly same as your “print all subsequences of string”**

### **Must Do**

| Problem                              | Platform            |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Subsets                              | LeetCode 78         |
| Subsets II (with duplicate handling) | LeetCode 90         |
| Combination Sum                      | LeetCode 39         |
| Combination Sum II                   | LeetCode 40         |
| Letter Case Permutation              | LeetCode 784        |
| Generate Parentheses                 | LeetCode 22         |
| Permutations                         | LeetCode 46         |
| Permutations II                      | LeetCode 47         |
| Power Set                            | GFG / LC 78 pattern |

All of these → **2 recursive calls**:

* ek baar include
* ek baar exclude

# ✅ **2. Strings – Recursion Based**

| Problem                   | Platform      |
| ------------------------- | ------------- |
| Decode Ways               | LeetCode 91   |
| Restore IP Addresses      | LeetCode 93   |
| Palindrome Partitioning   | LeetCode 131  |
| Letter Tile Possibilities | LeetCode 1079 |

---

# ✅ **3. Classic Binary Recursion**

| Problem                    | Notes             |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Fibonacci using recursion  | same as your code |
| Climbing Stairs            | similar           |
| Unique Binary Search Trees | recursive formula |
| House Robber               | include / exclude |

---

# 🚀 **4. Binary Decision + Constraint (Exactly like coin toss without consecutive H)**

| Problem                                        | Platform |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| N-Queens                                       | LC 51    |
| N-Queens II                                    | LC 52    |
| Generate Binary Strings without consecutive 1s | GFG      |
| Print all valid parentheses                    | LC 22    |
| Letter Combinations of a Phone Number          | LC 17    |
| Word Search (DFS)                              | LC 79    |
| Combination Sum with constraints               | LC 40    |

Tumhare code jaisa constraint check:

```
if(last != 'H') {
    call1(...)
}
call2(...)
```

Exactly same logic *N-Queens, parentheses, binary strings everywhere.*

---

# ✅ **5. Backtracking Grid Based (Still 2 recursive calls but on directions)**

| Problem           | Platform    |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| Rat in a Maze     | GFG         |
| Word Search       | LeetCode 79 |
| Number of Islands | LC 200      |
| Sudoku Solver     | LC 37       |
| Flood Fill        | LC 733      |

# 🔥 **MOST COMMON INTERVIEW PATTERNS USING 2-RECURSIVE CALLS**

1. **Subset / Subsequence**
2. **Combinations**
3. **Include / Exclude DP**
4. **Backtracking with Constraints**
5. **Binary Strings with rules**

Tumne jo seekha hai → tum 70% recursion interview problems solve kar sakte ho.
